# Database Schema

Confirmed VPN uses two databases: one Postgres and one Redis. The following documents each database's schema and purpose.

## Postgres
The Postgres database stores Admin Users, Certificates, Partner Snapshots, Partner Users, Partners, Subscriptions, Support Users, and Users.

### Tables

#### certificates
This table stores client certificates, which are sent to clients on Main `/get-key`. These certificates allow the client to authenticate with and use the VPNs.

Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`serial` | `text` | Serial of the certificate.
`source_id` | `text` | The Source ID that this certificate belongs to.
`user_id` | `text` | The User ID associated with this certificate.
`revoked` | `boolean` | Whether or not this certificate has been revoked. If evidence is found of this certificate being abusive, this is set to `true` and the user is throttled heavily.
`assigned` | `boolean` | Whether or not this certificate has been assigned. When a new user is created and confirmed, it is assigned a certificate and this value changes from `false` to `true`.
`p12_encrypted` | `text` | The client certificate AES encrypted with `AES_P12_KEY`. This is decrypted and sent to user on Main `POST /get-key`.

#### users

These are consumers/users. A user is created by either IAP receipt or email/password. A user cannot sign in using email until their email is confirmed.

The users table has both `email` and `email_encrypted` columns because `email` allows fast checking of whether or not an email exists in the database (frequently done), and `email_encrypted` allows slow actual retrieval of the email (rarely done). The email is not stored in plaintext as an added layer of security.

Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`id` | `text` | User ID
`email` | `text` | SHA512 hash of user email with `EMAIL_SALT`.
`email_encrypted` | `text` | AES encrypted user email with `AES_EMAIL_KEY`.
`password` | `text` | BCrypted user password.
`stripe_id` | `text` | Stripe ID of the user.
`email_confirmed` | `boolean` | Whether or not the email is confirmed.
`email_confirm_code` | `text` | Code to confirm an email.
`change_email` | `text` | Hash of email to change to.
`password_reset_code` | `text` | Code to reset password.
`month_usage_megabytes` | `integer` | Monthly usage in megabytes.
`month_usage_update` | `timestamp` | Last time monthly usage was updated.

#### subscriptions

Each row is a subscription. Subscriptions can be of `receipt_type` `ios`, `android`, or `stripe`. Subscriptions are updated by Main in various APIs (`/signin`, `/subscription-event`, etc), but also updated by Renewer when `expiration_date` is coming up.

Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`user_id` | `text` | User ID
`receipt_id` | `text` | iOS, Android, or Stripe receipt ID
`receipt_type` | `receipt_type` | Can be `ios`, `android`, or `stripe`
`plan_type` | `plan_type` | Can be `ios-monthly`, `ios-annual`, `all-monthly`, `all-annual`, `android-monthly`, or `android-annual`
`expiration_date` | `timestamp` | Time that user's subscription expires
`cancellation_date` | `timestamp` | Time that user's subscription is cancelled
`receipt_data` | `text` | Receipt data encrypted with `AES_RECEIPT_KEY`
`in_trial` | `boolean` | Whether or not subscription is in trial (unreliable flag sometimes)
`failed_last_check` | `boolean` | Whether or not last Renewer update check for this entry failed.
`renew_enabled` | `boolean` | Whether or not subscription's renewal is enabled (unreliable flag sometimes)
`updated` | `timestamp` | Time this subscription was last updated, either through Main API (like `/subscription-event`) or Renewer

#### admin\_users & support\_users

These are super slimmed down versions of `users`. These track Admin and Support users. Email is kept in plaintext.

Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`email` | `text` | Plaintext email.
`password` | `text` | BCrypted user password.
`email_confirmed` | `boolean` | Whether or not the email is confirmed.
`email_confirm_code` | `text` | Code to confirm an email.
`password_reset_code` | `text` | Code to reset password.

### Security
The Postgres database is accessible by all Confirmed servers except VPN. Security Groups prevent external direct access to the database.

Each server type (Main, Renewer, Helper, etc) can only use a specific database `ROLE` with the bare minimum permissions scoped to only what the server type needs. For example, `renewer` can do `SELECT` and `UPDATE` on the `subscriptions` table, but has no access at all to the `users` table.

Specific grants are located in `schema.sql`.

## Redis

The Redis database is used for Brute Force Tracking, User Sessions, and Admin/Support User Sessions.

### Security

Redis on AWS is hosted in a private VPC not accessible by the internet. All Confirmed servers access Redis with encrypted transit (TLS) and a Redis AUTH secret stored in `REDIS_PASSWORD`. Encryption at rest is enabled.

### Management

Brute Force restrictions can be looked up and cleared in the Admin Dashboard.

### Keys

Prefix | Description
--- | ---
`a:` | Admin User Sessions
`u:` | User Sessions
`erl:` | Rate Limiting Tracking
`s:` | Support User Sessions
